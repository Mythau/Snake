# Snake
21/10/25

Hello this is a practice project. I'm very much still learning to both use github and object oriented features, the purpose of this project and probably quite a few more is to learn these features.

This snake game is a console based game with ascii characters to represent the playing field, and the field is redrawn every single tick.

The current objective is to learn to use github effectively as I'm developing this on a desktop & a laptop.

This game is currently incomplete, and the game logic is a work in progress. This is the first time I've tried any of this.

If you find yourself here, firstly are you lost? and secondly I'm proud of my progress and hope that you'll be able to provide some constructive criticism. I'm definitely open to learning new ways to develop.
As stated the current focus is to understand the object oriented machinations of C++, but it is not the end all be all.
